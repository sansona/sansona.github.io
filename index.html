					<h2><font color=black>Welcome to Chem-Illumination beta</font></h2>
				</header>
				<p><font color=black>Hello, this is <strong>Chem-Illumination</strong>, a chemistry site created by an undergraduate @ UCLA who has far more free time than he should. The goal of this site is to create a comprehensive guide to undergraduate chemistry courses. As of now, the chemistry resources available on the internet are abundant but often focus on the facts while omitting explanations, leaving students with the feeling that chemistry is spoken in a language they do not understand. My goal is to make a resource that provides students with a basis of reasoning behind the principles of chemistry.</font></p>

							<h2><font color=black>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</font></h2>
						</header>
						<p><font color=black>"Francie came away from her first chemistry lecture in a glow. In one hour she found out that everything was made up of atoms which were in continual motion. She grasped the idea that nothing was ever lost or destroyed. Even if something was burned up or rot away, it did not disappear from the face of the earth; it changed into something else - gases, liquids, and powders. Everything, decided Francie after that first lecture, was vibrant with life and there was no death in chemistry. She was puzzled as to why learned people didn't adopt chemistry as a religion."</font></p>

							<h2><font color=black>The Central Science</font></h2>
						</header>
						<p><font color=black>Chemistry is often referred to as the "central science." The reason behind this is that the core of every scientific field is based off exploring chemical phenomena and change. Classical physics is the change of motion. Biology is the development and change of living systems. No matter what field of science you're in, chemistry will be at the center of it.</font></p>
