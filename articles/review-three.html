			<br>
			<p>#1. Atoms bond for two main reasons. First, atoms bond in order to satisfy valency. This explains why elements with satisfied octets do not react: they have no reason to. Second, atoms bond to achieve a more stable state. By creating a bond, the atoms involved in bonding release energy.</p>
			<br>
      <p>#2. A high bond polarity indicates that the atoms involved in bonding have a large difference in electronegativity.</p>
      <br>
      <p>#3. The electrons will be drawn more towards the electronegative atom because, by definition, electronegative atoms desire electrons more strongly than less electronegative atoms do.</p>
      <br>
      <p>#4. The stronger the bond, the shorter it is. The two have an inverse relationship where, as one increases, the other decreases.</p>
      <br>
      <p>#5. Intermolecular: Van der Waals interactions, Hydrogen Bonds, and Metallic Bonds. Intramolecular: Polar bonds and Ionic Bonds, </p>
      <br>
      <p>#6. Elements after P have access to the d-orbitals and thus are able to contain more electrons. The only elements that strictly follow the octet rule are atoms 6-14.</p>
      <br>
      <p>#7. Number of bonds and number of lone pairs</p>
      <br>
      <p>#8. For molecular geometry, bonds and lone pairs are distinct. For electron geometry, both are counted as the same.</p>
      <br>
      <p>#9. The higher the bond order, the stronger the bond. Thus, the bond with the higher bond order will have a shorter length relative to the other bond.</p>
      <br>
      <p>#10. Polyatomic ions are ions composed of multiple atoms that are very likely to stay in that molecular form. Whenever you see a polyatomic ion, you can treat it as a single atom.</p>
