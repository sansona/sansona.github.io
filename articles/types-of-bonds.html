<p>There are several types of attractive forces which result from either differences in electronegativity or dipole moments. A bond is a <b>permanent attractive force.</b> Additionally, it's important to distinguish <b>intermolecular and intramolecular forces.</b> An intramolecular force is between that atoms makeup a molecule. An intermolecular force is between entire molecules. </p>

<br><br>
    <h7><center>Non-Polar Covalent Bonds</center></h7>
<br>
    <center><b>Intramolecular</b></center>
<br>
    <img class=center src="../images/covalent-bond-h2.png" alt="H2 Covalent Bond" width="70%">
    <p>A non-polar covalent bond occurs when the <font color=red>electrons are equally shared between atoms</font>. For example, in `H_2` the 2 bonding electrons are equidistant from each H atom. Just as the name implies, the bond is non-polar and thus no dipole moment exists.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This type of bond exists when the bonding atoms are the same or have very similar electronegativities. <font color=red>The maximum polarity for a non-polar covalent bond is 0.5.</font></p>
    
<br><br>
    <h7><center>Polar-Covalent</center></h7>
<br>
    <center><b>Intramolecular</b></center>
  <br>
    <img class=center src="../images/polar-covalent-bonds.jpg" alt="Polar-Covalent Bonds" width=55%>
    <br>
    <p>A polar-covalent bond is a bond where there is an <font color=red>unequal sharing of electrons between atoms.</font> This occurs for bonds between atoms that have a moderate difference in electronegativity. <font color=red>The range of polarity for a polar-covalent bond is 0.5 - 1.6</font></p>
    <br>
    <p>For example, the H-O bonds in water are considered non-polar covalent bonds. The polarity for the H-O bond is calculated as follows:</p>
    <br>
    <p align=center>`"Polarity"_(H-O): |EN_O - EN_H|= |3.44-2.20|=1.24`</p>
    <br>
    <p> Since this polarity value is in between 0.5 and 1.6, the H-O bond is considered a polar-covalent bond.</p>

    
    
<br><br>
    <h7><center>Ionic Bonds</center></h7>
  <br>
      <center><b>Intramolecular</b></center>
  <br>
    <img class=center src="../images/naf.gif" alt="NaF Ionic Bond" width="75%">
    <br>
    <p>An ionic bond is a bond between atoms of <font color=red>very high differences in electronegativity (greater than 1.6).</font> In ionic bonds, there is a <b>transfer of electrons.</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>This is seen in the .gif above. The highly electronegative F atom takes an electron away from the valence shell of Na. This ends up satisfying both octets of F and Na.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Ionic bonds end up creating <b>ions</b>, which are atoms where the <font color=red># of electrons is different from the # of protons.</font> In the example, the F atom has 8 electrons compared to its usual 7 and the Na atom has 8 valence electrons compared to its usual 1. Thus, both are now ionized. The result of F gaining an additional electron is that it now has a net negative charge: we denote the fluorine ion as `F^-`. The same goes for Na: since Na lost an electron, it now has a net positive charge leaving it as `Na^+`.</p>
    


<br><br>
    <h7><center>Metallic Bonds</center></h7>
  <br>
      <center><b>Intermolecular</b></center>

    <img class=center src="../images/metallic-bond.png" alt="Metallic Bond" width=60%>
    <p>A metallic bond describes the <b>intermolecular bonding</b> of metals. This means that a metallic bond describes why many atoms of metals bond together rather than why a single atom of metal bonds to another single atom. Recall that the transition metals are the elements in the d-block of the periodic table. Since these d-electrons are not involved in valency, they are free to move around. The result is that there is a <b>sea of electrons</b>. Since each metal atom had to give away electrons to contribute to this sea, the atoms themselves have a positive charge (seen below). <font color=red>The bonding of metals is a result of the free d-electrons and the positive charges on the metal.</font></p>

    <h7><center>Van der Waals Interactions</center></h7>
    <br>
        <center><b>Intermolecular</b></center>
    <br>
    <img class=center src="../images/london-dispersion.png" alt="London Dispersion" width="60%">
    <p>These are also known as <b>London Dispersion Forces</b> and <b>Dipole-Induced Dipoles</b> and occur <font color=red>between all molecules</font>. We use Van der Waals interactions primarily to explain why molecules that don't have bonds or coulombic attraction will still demonstrate a slight attraction for one another. This is because of slight distortions in the electron cloud, which create slight `delta^+` and `delta^-` within the molecule.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We can see this in the image above. Normally the molecules wouldn't be attracted to each other, but once the electron cloud of one molecule moves slightly off-center, that molecule temporarily has a higher amount of electrons on one side than the other. This surplus of electrons then induces the electron cloud of the neighboring molecule to move away, inducing a dipole in the new molecule. This continues on and <font color=red>results in an attractive force where there would normally be no attractive forces.</font></p>
    <br>
    <p>Van der Waals Interactions are <b>temporarily interactions</b> and are usually <b>significantly weaker</b> than permanent bonds.</p>

<br><br>
    <h7><center>Hydrogen Bonds</center></h7>
  <br>
      <center><b>Intermolecular</b></center>

  <img  class=center src="../images/h-bond-dipole.png" alt="H Bond Dipole" width=60%>
  <p>A hydrogen bond is a variation of the Van der Waals Interaction that involves <font color=red>H bonding to N, O, or F</font>. Hydrogen forms a particularly strong bond to these 3 elements which results in a strong dipole moment along the bond. Since the H now has a `delta^+` on it, it is attracted to surrounding atoms with `delta^-`. The result of this is that molecules with H bonded to N, O, or F will be attracted to each other through Coulombic attraction.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The <font color=red>H-bond is an attractive force between entire molecules, not the H-(N,O, or F) bond itself</font>.This may be confusing seeing as bond is in the name, but the <font color=red> H-bond is not an actual bond, but an attractive force</font>. If you check out the picture on top, the O atom of the left water molecule is slightly attracted to the H atom of the right water molecule due to the induced `delta`s. This is called an <b>intermolecular force</b> as it involves the force between entire molecules, as opposed to the atoms within the molecule. The result of this is that molecules that contain H-(N,O, or F) bonds will be more bonded to each other than usual. </p>
  <br>

    <h7><center>Relative Strength of Attractive
    <br><br>Forces</center></h7>
  <br>
  <p> The general trend of strength in the different types of bonds is as follows:</p>
  <br>
  <center><p><b>(Strongest)</b><font color=maroon>: Ionic Bonds > Polar Covalent Bonds > Non-Polar Covalent Bonds > Hydrogen Bonds >Van der Waals Interactions: </font><b>(Weakest)</b></p></center>
