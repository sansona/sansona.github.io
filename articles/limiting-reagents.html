<p>Let's say that you're the manager of a car factory and need to order new parts for the purpose of building cars. In order to build 1 car, you need 1 body, 4 tires, and 2 side mirrors (You're building a futuristic car that doesn't require an engine or a steering wheel). You want to build 100 cars, so you do the math and order 100 bodies, 400 tires, and 200 side mirrors. Once the order arrives, you disappointingly discover that the delivery company broke 10 of the mirrors in transit. How does this affect your production?</p>
<br>
<p>Obviously now you can't build all 100 cars like you intended to. Without the 10 mirrors, 5 of the cars cannot be built. The mirrors are going to limit how many cars you can build; we can call the mirrors the limiting piece because they limit the number of cars we can build. Even after all the mirrors have been used, there will be remaining tires and bodies that cannot be used.</p>
<br>
<p>The same principle applies to chemistry. In real life, reactions usually do not have the perfect amounts of reactants needed in order to fully react. The <b>limiting reagent</b> or <b>limiting reactant</b> is the reactant that there is a lack of. If this is confusing, think of it this way: <font color=red>the limiting reactant is the reactant that runs out first.</font>Consider the reaction:</p>
<br>
<p align=center> `4Al + 3O_2 rArr 2Al_2O_3`.</p>
<br>
<p>For every mole of Al you have, you need `3/4&nbsp;"mol"&nbsp;O_2` to react with it. If you don't have this amount, what happens? Here's a simulation to help illuminate the concept. I recommend playing around with the sandwiches first, then moving onto actual molecules.</p>

<p><b>#1. You have 107.5 g Al and 64 g `O_2`.</b></p>
<p class="tabbed"><b>a) Calculate the amount of `Al_2O_3` formed in the reaction `4Al + 3O_2 rArr 2Al_2O_3`</b></p>
<p align=center><font color=darkslategrey>First step as always is to convert to moles.</font></p>
<br>
<p align=center><font color=darkslategrey>`(107.5&nbsp;g&nbsp;Al)((1&nbsp;mol)/(26.982&nbsp;g&nbsp;Al))=4&nbsp;"mol"&nbsp;Al`</font></p>
<br>
<p align=center><font color=darkslategrey>`(64&nbsp;g&nbsp;O_2)((1&nbsp;"mol")/(32&nbsp;g&nbsp;O_2))=2&nbsp;"mol"&nbsp;O_2`</font></p>
<br>
<p><font color=darkslategrey>Note: The molecular weight of `O_2` is `(32&nbsp;g)/("mol")` because there are 2 oxygen atoms per molecule of `O_2.`</font></p>
<br>
<p align=center><font color=darkslategrey> You can probably tell where this is headed. The equation calls for 4 mol Al and 3 mol `O_2`, but we only have 2 mol `O_2`. Just from that, we know that `O_2` is going to be our limiting reactant. Since the `O_2` runs out first, the `O_2` now determines how much of the product is formed. It will usually not be this easy to identify the limiting reactant, as you'll see in practice problems soon.</font></p>
<br>
<p align=center>N<font color=darkslategrey>ow we just have to convert the amount of `O_2` we have into `Al_2O_3`. We don't have to worry about the Al because that's in excess compared to the `O_2`; even after we use up all of our `O_2`, some Al will remain unreacted.</font></p>
<br>
<p align=center> <font color=darkslategrey>`(2&nbsp;"mol"&nbsp;O_2)((2&nbsp;"mol"&nbsp;Al_2O_3)/(3&nbsp;"mol"&nbsp;O_2))=4/3&nbsp;"mol"&nbsp;Al_2O_3`</font></p>
<br>
<p align=center> <font color=darkslategrey>`(4/3&nbsp;"mol"&nbsp;Al_2O_3)((102&nbsp;g&nbsp;Al_2O_3)/(1&nbsp;"mol"&nbsp;Al_2O_3))=136&nbsp;g&nbsp;Al_2O_3`</font></p>
<br>
<p align=center><font color=darkslategrey><b>Answer:</b> In total, 136 g of `Al_2O_3` will be produced.</font></p>
<br>
<p align=center><i>If the conversion factors don't make sense, consider reviewing the previous sections:</i></p>

<br>
<p class="tabbed"><b>b) Which one of the reactants is the limiting reactant?</b></p>
<p align=center><font color=darkslategrey>The limiting reactant is the reactant that runs out first. In this reaction, `O_2` runs out first. Therefore, `O_2` is the limiting reactant.</font></p>
<br>
<p class="tabbed"><b>c) Which one of the reactants is in excess? How much of this reactant remains?</b></p>
<p> <font color=darkslategrey>If `O_2` is the limiting reactant, Al must be in excess. To calculate how much Al remains, we simply have to look at how much was used in the reaction with `O_2`.</font></p>
<br>
<p align=center><font color=darkslategrey>`(2&nbsp;"mol"&nbsp;O_2)((4&nbsp;"mol"&nbsp;Al)/(3&nbsp;"mol"&nbsp;O_2))=8/3&nbsp;"mol"&nbsp;Al`</font></p>
<br>
<p align=center><font color=darkslategrey>`(8/3&nbsp;"mol"&nbsp;Al)((26.982&nbsp;g&nbsp;Al)/(1&nbsp;mo))=71.7&nbsp;g&nbsp;Al`</font></p>
<br>
<p><font color=darkslategrey>This means that 71.7 g of Al was used to react with the entirety of `O_2.` This should be less Al than we have in total since not all of it reacted. We started off with 4 moles Al; let's see how much is left.</font></p>
<br>
<p align=center><font color=darkslategrey>`(4&nbsp;"mol"&nbsp;Al)((26.892&nbsp;g&nbsp;Al)/(1&nbsp;"mol"))=107.6&nbsp;g&nbsp;Al`</font></p>
<br>
<p><font color=darkslategrey>This means we used less Al than we started off with! This makes sense since the Al is in excess. To see how much Al we have left, we simply have to subtract the amount we used from the initial amount.</font></p>
<br>
<p align=center><font color=darkslategrey>`Initial_(Al)-Reacted_(Al)=107.6&nbsp;g-71.7&nbsp;g=29.9&nbsp;g`</font></p>
<br>
<p align=center><font color=darkslategrey><b>Answer:</b> `29.9&nbsp;g`</font></p>
<br>
<p><font color=darkslategrey>In conclusion, we have 29.9 g Al left over after all of the `O_2` runs out. Let's sum what we've done in this problem:</font></p>
<br>
  <li><p style="margin-left:40px"><font color=maroon>1. Converted all given amounts to moles.</font></p></li>
  <li><p style="margin-left:40px"><font color=maroon>2. Determined the limiting reactant by looking at the chemical equation.</font></p></li>
  <li><p style="margin-left:40px"><font color=maroon>3. Convert the moles of limiting reactant to moles of product by using the conversion factor.</font></p></li>
  <li><p style="margin-left:40px"><font color=maroon>4. Convert the moles product to grams product.</font></p></li>
  <li><p style="margin-left:40px"><font color=maroon>5. Determined the amount of Al in excess by converting moles of the limiting reactant to grams Al.</font></p></li>
<br><p>I highly recommend you go through the problem and make sure you understand why each step was taken and the mathematical process behind each step. Instead of memorizing the steps, make sure you understand the purpose behind each one. In the final review of this section, we'll go over more difficult limiting reagent problems. </p>
