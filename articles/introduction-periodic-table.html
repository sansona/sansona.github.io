<p> The periodic table is one of the simplest and most useful tools available to chemists. As mentioned previously, one can predict various chemical properties just by looking at the periodic table! I recommend using this one for convenience: </p>

  <h7><center>History: Mendeleev</center></h7>
<br>
  <p> The periodic table is a table containing information about all of the known elements ranging from common ones like oxygen to more rare ones such as francium. The idea behind the table belongs to Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian chemist from the 19th century. After the death of his father when Mendeleev was 13 years old, his mother was determined to get Mendeleev educated and walked him all the way from Siberia to Moscow, 2200 miles, in order to make this happen. Talk about caring about her child's future. There, Mendeleev studied chemistry and began to notice trends between elements. To organize these trends, Mendeleev created a chart which is now referred to as the first attempt at a periodic table.</p>
  <br>

    <p align=center><font color=brown>Mendeleev's chart organizing elements based off similarities</font></p>
<br>
  <p>  With this chart, Mendelev was able to describe the properties of different elements and was the first to organize trends between different elements. In fact, he was even able to predict the behavior of 8 elements that had not even been discovered yet!</p>

<br><br>
<h7><center>Groups</center></h7>
<br>
<p>Columns (up and down) in the periodic table are called groups. Starting from the left, the column with H, Li, K...Fr is known as group 1. The one immediately to the right of it consisting of Be, Mg, Ca...Ra is group 2. This continues until group 18 with He, Ne...Rn. To start you off with understanding the table, let's take a look at a couple different groups.</p>
<br>
<li><font color=maroon>Group 1: Alkali Metals. These elements are very reactive.</font></li>
<li><font color=maroon>Group 2: Alkaline Earth Metals. These elements are similarly very reactive.</font></li>
<li><font color=maroon>Group 3-12: Transition Metals: These elements have a lot of different properties, but in general are shiny and electrically conductive metals that form solid compounds at room temperature.</font></li>
<li><font color=maroon>Group 17: Halogens. These elements are very reactive and in general dangerous elements. Not things to be triffled with.</font></li>
<li><font color=maroon>Group 18: Noble Gases. These elements are all gases that do not react with anything. We sometimes call these "inert" gases.</font></li>
<br>
  <p> There you have your first understanding of the periodic table! If anyone were to ever ask you whether a halogen (group 17) element was likely to be dangerous or safe to handle, you would know to answer that they are dangerous, due to their reactivity! We'll explain why this is shortly.</p>
  
  <br><br>
  <h7><center>Reading the Periodic Table</center></h7>
  <br>
  <p> If you recall, the previous post on atomic structure made the claim that atoms are composed of a dense nuclear core, made up of protons and neutrons, with an electron cloud surrounding the core. Right afterwards, I made the claim that the identity of an atom depended solely on the number of protons it had.</p>
   <br>
    <p> It turns out that the periodic table organizes elements by this same metric. The <font color=red> atomic number of an element refers to how many protons it has. This number can be located on top of each element on the periodic table:</font></p>
      <img class="center" src="../images/atomic-number.png" alt="Atomic Numbers" width="50%">
      <p align=center><font color=brown>The small number on top of each element tells you the atomic number, how many protons the element has. For example, B has 5, C has 6, and S has 16.</font></p>
      <br>
    <p>The number of electrons for any neutral atoms will be the same as the number of protons. The number of electrons changes as atoms become charged or react with other atoms, but <font color=red>the number of protons must remain the same.</font> You may have noticed that there is another number underneath the atomic symbols. This brings us to our next topic:</p>
    
<br><br>
    <h7><center>Atomic Mass</center></h7>
<br>
    <p>We've established that atoms are made up of a dense nuclear core, consisting of protons and neutrons, with electrons in orbit around. The question that probably crossed your mind is "why is the nucleus so much denser than the rest of the atoms?" To answer this, we have to introduce the concept of mass. Informally, <b>Mass is how much something weighs.</b> Different elements will have different masses because of the difference in the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons:</p>
<br>
      <li><p style="margin-left:40px"><font color=maroon>Protons have a charge of +1 and a mass of 1 amu, or `m_p = 1.67 * 10^-27 ` kg.</font></p></li>
      <li><p style="margin-left:40px"><font color=maroon>Neutrons have a charge of 0 and a mass of 1 amu, or `m_n = 1.67 * 10^-27 ` kg.</font></p></li>
      <li><p style="margin-left:40px"><font color=maroon>Electrons have a charge of -1 and a mass of roughly 0 amu, or `m_e = 9.11 * 10^-31 kg`</font></p></li>
<br>

   <p> There are a couple things to take away from this. First, protons and neutrons have the same mass. Second, electrons weigh practically nothing. From this information, we can calculate the <font color=red>atomic mass, which is the total mass of all protons, neutrons, and electrons in an atom. For example:</font></p>
   <p> Boron is element 5. That means it has 5 protons, 5 neutrons, and 5 electrons. The atomic mass of Boron is therefore:</p>
   <br>
  
  <p align="center"><b>`5m_p + 5m_n + 5m_e = 5(1&nbsp;"amu") + 5(1&nbsp;"amu") +5(0&nbsp;"amu") = 10&nbsp;"amu"`</b></p>
  <br>
  <p>This is pretty close to the value of `10.81&nbsp;"amu"` given on the periodic table! The `0.81` difference can be attributed to the actual mass of electrons: we say that electrons have a mass of 0 amu to simplify calculations, but in reality, <i> electrons just have a very, very small mass compared to protons and neutrons, so we leave them out of the calculations.</i> To figure out exactly how much more "massive" the protons and neutrons are compared to electrons, we can just divide them: </p>
  <br>
    <p align="center">`(m_p)/(m_e) = (m_n)/(m_e) = (1.67 * 10^-27&nbsp;"kg")/(9.11 * 10^-31&nbsp;"kg") = 1833`</p>
  <br>
  
  <p>This means that protons and neutrons are nearly 2000 times as massive as electrons are! This is why the nucleus is the densest part of the atom: the proton and neutrons have nearly combined are roughly 4000 times the mass of electrons.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Something to note: all of the atomic mass values on the periodic table are calculated in the lab via. experiments. However, we can calculate them to a good degree of accuracy just by adding together the approximate mass of the protons, neutrons, and electrons for any given atom. This allows us to know how much a certain atom will weigh. Later on we will see what makes the atomic mass so important. For now, here's a simulation of how atoms look.</p>
  <br>
  <center><iframe src="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/build-an-atom/latest/build-an-atom_en.html" width="600" height="400" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
  <br>
  <p>Notice that only by adding protons can you change the identity of the element. The addition of neutrons and electrons do not affect the identity of the element, only the stability.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h7><center>Atomic Symbols</center></h7>
  <br>
  <p>Hopefully you've noticed by now that the periodic table labels different elements in shorthand. For example, element #6, labeled C, is carbon. Most of the symbols are just shorthand for the name of the element,O for oxygen, while others may not be so straightforward, Hg for mercury.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Unless you get a really mean professor or are preparing for a periodic table recitation competition (don't think these happen too often), you probably won't have to know the symbols by heart. It may seem overwhelming as of now, but in no time, you'll be able to tell what element a symbol refers to. If you go back to the simulation above and play with the symbol option, you can see directly how the atomic symbol works.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Regardless, here are some of the common ones to get you started:</p>
<br>
      <li><b>H</b>: Hydrogen</li>
      <li><b>He</b>: Helium</li>
      <li><b>Li</b>: Lithium</li>
      <li><b>B</b>: Boron</li>
      <li><b>C</b>: Carbon</li>
      <li><b>N</b>: Nitrogen</li>
      <li><b>O</b>: Oxygen</li>
      <li><b>Na</b>: Sodium</li>
      <li><b>Mg</b>: Magnesium</li>
      <li><b>P</b>: Phosphorus</li>
      <li><b>Cl</b>: Chlorine</li>
      <li><b>K</b>: Potassium</li>
  <br>
  <p>Additionally, here's a fun comic done by SMBC using atomic symbols. Warning: very slight inappropriate language.</p>
  <img class=center src="../images/smbc-atomic-symbols.gif" width=60%>
<br>
<br>
  <h7><center> Summary</center></h7>
<br>
      <li><p><font color=blue>Columns going up and down are called groups. Elements belonging to the same group are likely to have similar properties.</font></p></li>
      <li><p><font color=blue>The atomic number is the number of protons that a given element has. This is the small number above the elemental symbol in the periodic table. This number is inherent for a given element and cannot change.</font></p></li>
      <li><p><font color=blue>The atomic mass is the total sum of the mass of all protons, neutrons, and electrons for a given element. This can be found by simply adding all the masses, in amu, together.</font></p></li>
      <li><p><font color=blue>Protons have a charge of +1 and a mass of 1 amu. Neutrons have a charge of 0 and a mass of 1 amu. Electrons have a charge of -1 and an approximate mass of 0 amu.</font></p></li>
<br>
<br>
<h7><center>Fun Facts</center></h7>
<br>
<p><b>1. Where do the atomic symbols come from?</b></p>
<br>
<p>Behind each atomic symbol is a story. Lead is one example. Lead's atomic symbol is Pb as the Latin word for lead is "plumbum." This is because lead used to be used for plumbing. We now know that this is an absolutely terrible idea: by using lead for plumbing, lead was introduced into the water system which resulted in people consuming and drinking lead. Lead is an extremely toxic element to humans, which is why lead paint and leaded gasoline is now banned.</p>
<br>
<p>Usually, the element is named after either the discoverer or the location that the discovery was made. Element 97, berkelium, was named after the University of California, Berkeley, where it was discovered. Every so often, the elements will be named after someone unrelated to the project. For example, elements 99 and 100, einsteinium and fermium, are named after the renowned physicists Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi</p>
<br>
<p>Some of the elements are still not named. For example, elements 113 and 115 have the atomic symbols Uut and Uup, which stand for ununtrium and ununpentium respectively. These are placeholder names until the atomic symbol can be attributed to someone or something justified. Regardless, it's always interesting to read about how the elements were named.</p>
