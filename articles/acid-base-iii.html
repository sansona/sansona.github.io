			  <h7><center>Conjugate Pairs</center></h7>
			  <br>
			  <p>When an acid dissociates according to the following general equation:</p>
			  <br>
			  <p align=center>`HA +H_2O &harr; H_3O^+ + A^-`</p>
			  <br>
			  <p>`A^-` is called the <b>conjugate base</b> of `HA` .</p>
			  <br>
			  <p><b>Whenever an acid dissociates, it forms a conjugate base</b>. The acid and conjugate base form a <b>conjugate pair</b>. For example, in the dissociation of `H_ 2CO_3` , </p>
			  <br>
			  <p align=center>`H_2CO_3 +H_2O&harr; H_3O^+ + HCO_3^-`</p>
			  <br>
			  <p>`H_2CO_3` is the acid while `HCO_3` is the conjugate base. The two of them form a conjugate pair.</p>
			  <br>
			  <p>The reason that the deprotonated acid is called the conjugate base is that <font color=red>in the reverse reaction, the deprotonated acid now behaves as a base</font>. `HCO_3^-` is able to accept a proton in the reverse reaction to form `H_2CO_3` , which, according to the Bronsted-Lowry definition, is exactly what a base does!</p>
			  <br>
			  <p>We can express this in the following "statement":</p>
			  <br>
			  <p align=center>`"Acid" + "Water" &harr; "Conjugate Base" + "Hydronium Ion"`</p>
			  <br>
			  <p>Notice that there are actually <font color=red>two conjugate pairs in this reaction</font>: Acid-Conjugate Base, and Water-Hydronium Ion. If you'll notice, the conjugate pairs always vary by one proton. Water (`H_2O`) and Hydronium Ion `H_3O^+` vary by one proton. In this situation, the hydronium ion is the acid and water the conjugate base.</p>
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  <p><font color=red>Depending on the strength of the acid, we can determine the strength of the conjugate base</font>. <b>If the acid is strong, the conjugate base will be weak</b>. The dissociation of `HCl` for example:</p>
			  <br>
			  <p align=center>`HCl + H_2O &harr; H_3O^+ + Cl^-`</p>
			  <br>
			  <p>The acid-conjugate base pair is clearly `HCl` and `Cl^-` . If the acid is strong, we know that the equilibrium strongly favors the right side. This means that the reverse reaction is not favored and thus, `Cl^-` must be a weak base. </p>
			  <br>
			  <p>Now consider the dissociation of a weak acid:</p>
			  <br>
			  <p align=center>`CH_3COOH + H_2O &harr; H_3O^+ + CH_3COO^-`</p>
			  <br>
			  <p>Since we know that the acid is weak, we know that the reaction favors the left. This means that `CH_3COO^-` is a more potent base, as it reacts with a proton to drive the reaction to the left. We don't say that the conjugate base is a strong base, as that would imply that the reaction is completely to the left. Instead, we say that the conjugate base is stronger in comparison to the acid.</p>
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  <p>To summarize:</p>
			  <br>
			  <p style=margin-left:60px>`"Strong acid" + "Water" &harr; "Weak conjugate base" + "Hydronium ion"`</p>
			  <br>
			  <p style=margin-left:60px>`"Weak acid" + "Water" &harr; "Strong(er) conjugate base" + "Hydronium ion"`</p>
			  <br>
			  <p>The same concepts apply for bases; just replace acid with base and base with acid in this section. The logic still applies:</p>
			  <br>
			  <p style=margin-left:60px>`"Strong base" + "Water" &harr; "Weak conjugate acid" + "Hydroxide ion"`</p>
			  <br>
			  <p style=margin-left:60px>`"Weak base" + "Water" &harr; "Strong(er) conjugate acid" + "Hydroxide ion"`</p>
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  <p>Here's a table of some common conjugate pairs:</p>
			  <br>
			  <table border="1" style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><p align=center>`H_3O^+`</p></td>
    <td><p align=center>`H_2O`</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p align=center>`NH_4^+`</p></td>
    <td><p align=center>`NH_3`</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p align=center>`CH_3COOH`</td>
    <td><p align=center>`CH_3COO^-`</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p align=center>`H_3O^+`</p></td>
    <td><p align=center>`H_2O`</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td><p align=center>`NH_3`</p></td>
  </tr>

  </tr>

			  <h7><center>Equilibrium Position of <br><br> Neutralization Reactions</center></h7>
			  <br>
			  <p>If a neutralization reaction reacts to completion (strong acid and strong base in equimolar amounts), the result will be water and a salt. If the neutralization reaction doesn't go to completion, we know that the result can be expressed as:</p>
			  <br>
			  <p align=center>`"Acid"+"Base" &harr; "Conjugate base" + "Conjugate acid"`</p>
			  <br>
			  <p>Notice that a salt and water are still technically there, just in the form of conjugate acids and bases.</p>
			  <br>
			  <p>We can predict which side the reaction favors by comparing the strength of the acids. <b>The position of equilibrium in a neutralization reaction will favor the formation of the weaker acid.</b> Consider the following reaction:</p>
			  <br>
			  <p align=center>`CH_3COOH + NH_3 &harr; NH_4^+ + CH_3COO^-`</p>
			  <br>
			  <p>It helps to write out a table:</p>
			  <br>
			  <table border="1" style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><p align=center>`CH_3COOH`</p></td>
    <td><p align=center>`NH_3`</p></td>
    <td><p align=center>`NH_4^+`</p></td>
    <td><p align=center>`CH_3COO^-`</p></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p align=center>Acid</p></td>
    <td><p align=center>Base</p></td>
    <td><p align=center>Conjugate acid</p></td>
    <td><p align=center>Conjugate base</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p align=center>`pK_a=5`</td>
    <td><p align=center></p></td>
    <td><p align=center>`pK_a=9`</p></td>
    <td><p align=center></p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
        <br>
        <p>Remember that the higher the `pK_a` , the weaker the acid. Since the weaker acid, `NH_4^+` , is on the right, the equilibrium position will favor the products.</p>

		<h7><center>Lewis Acid-Base Model</center></h7>
		<br>
		<p>While the Arrhenius and Bronsted-Lowry models of acids and bases work in most cases, every so often there will be a model that behaves like an acid or base while not conforming to either one of these models. The <b>Lewis Acid-Base Model</b> states that an <font color=red>acid is an electron pair acceptor</font> whereas a <font color=red>acid is an electron pair donor</font>. </p>
		<br>
		<p align=center><b>In the Lewis Acid-Base Model, acids are electron pair ACCEPTORS while bases are electron pair DONORS</b></p>
		<br>
		<p>This probably seems a bit counterintuitive as, thus far, all the models of acids and bases involve acids producing something whereas in this model, the acid accepts something. Think of it this way: in the Arrhenius and Bronsted-Lowry models, the acid producers a `H^+` and thereby ends up with a negative charge on the deprotonated atom. In the Lewis model, the acid also ends up with a net negative charge - only instead of this being from losing a positive charge, it comes from accepting a negative charge. <font color=red>The Lewis model can be thought of as an extension to the Bronsted-Lowry model</font>: in the Bronsted-Lowry model, the acid is a positive charge donor while the base is a positive charge acceptor. By donating a positive charge, the acid is concurrently accepting a negative charge. The Bronsted-Lowry and Lewis models are essentially saying the same thing, except that the Lewis model does not restrict the charge transfer to `H^+` . </p>
		<br>
		<p>The power of the Lewis model lies in its versatility. According to both the Arrhenius and Bronsted Lowry models, `BF_3` should not be an acid as it doesn't produce a proton. Experimentally, however, we know that `BF_3` is in fact a weak acid. For example, consider the reaction between `BF_3` and `NH_3` (ignore the bond lengths):</p>
		<br>
    <img class=center src="../images/nh3-bf3.png" width=70%>
		<br>
		<p>By accepting an electron pair, `BF_3` is able to bond with `NH_3` . The `B` atom incurs a negative charge while the `N` atom incurs a positive charge; just like how normal acid-base reactions end up. This explains why `BF_3` is acidic in solution even without a proton to donate.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Lewis acids are the umbrella under which Bronsted-Lowry and Arrhenius acids and bases fall under. If an acid is a Bronsted-Lowry acid, it must by extension be a Lewis Acid. The significance of the Lewis Acid-Base model lies in its versatility and simplicity. It turns out that many species behave acidically or basically without `H^+` or `OH^-` donations; the Lewis Acid-Base model explains why this is.</p>
		<br>
		<p>To summarize the three models of acids and bases, here's a table:</p>
		<br>
			  <table border="1" style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><p align=center><b>Model</b></p></td>
    <td><p align=center><b>Acid Definition</b></p></td>
    <td><p align=center><b>Base Definition</b></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p align=center>Arrhenius</p></td>
    <td><p align=center>`H^+` producer</p></td>
    <td><p align=center>`OH^-` producer</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p align=center>Bronsted-Lowry</p></td>
    <td><p align=center>`H^+` donor</p></td>
    <td><p align=center>`H^+` acceptor</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p align=center>Lewis</td>
    <td><p align=center>Electron Pair acceptor</p></td>
