		  <h7><center>Kinetic Molecular Theory</center></h7>
		  <br>
		  <p>The ideal gas law deals with the macroscopic properties of a gas, such as temperature, pressure, and volume. The theory behind how gases behave at a microscopic level is called the <b>Kinetic Molecular Theory</b> and has the following postulates:</p>
		  <br>
		  <p style="margin-left:40px"><font color=maroon>1. A gas consists of small gas molecules moving in a straight line until they hit the edges of the container they're in.</font></p>
		  <p style="margin-left:40px"><font color=maroon>2. The individual gas molecules can be assumed to occupy no volume.</font></p>
		  <p style="margin-left:40px"><font color=maroon>3. When gas molecules hit each other, they bounce off each other.</font></p>
		  <p style="margin-left:40px"><font color=maroon>4. The gas molecules are not attracted to or repelled by each other.</font></p>
		  <p style="margin-left:40px"><font color=maroon>5. The energy of a gas depends only on the overall temperature of a gas and nothing else.</font></p>
		  <br>
		  <p>These postulates are not 100% accurate, but provide a sufficient model for the behavior of gases in most conditions. Let's go through each postulate individually:</p>
		  <br>
		  <p><font color=maroon>1. A gas consists of small gas molecules moving in a straight line until they hit the edges of the container they're in.</font></p>
		  <br>
      <p style="margin-left:40px">Gas particles don't just move around randomly. If you've taken physics, you can understand what this means by saying that the molecules follow Newtonian motion. The particles move in a straight line until they either collide with the edge of the container they're in, or until they collide with another gas molecule at which point they both bounce off each other.</p>
      <br>
      <p><font color=maroon>2. The individual gas molecules can be assumed to occupy no volume.</font></p>
      <br>
      <p style="margin-left:40px">A single gas molecule is so small that we model the individual gas molecules as volume-less objects. In your room, there is an almost incomprehendible amount of gas molecules floating around, but the volume occupied by all of the molecules, if put together, would be negligible. This is why we model gas molecules as volume-less objects; in reality, they just occupy a negligible volume.</p>
      <br>
      <p><font color=maroon>3. When gas molecules hit each other, they bounce off each other.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left:40px">This ties into the 1st postulate, which states that gases travel in a straight line until they collide. When two gas molecules collide with each other, they bounce off each other as if they were two perfect rubber balls. For those who are familiar with physics: we can say that the molecules have perfectly elastic collision.</p>
      <br>
		  <p><font color=maroon>4. The gas molecules are not attracted to or repelled by each other.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left:40px">Recall that all objects have some level of attraction & repulsion through the existence of Van der Waals interactions. Gases exhibit these interactions as well, though the attractive forces are so miniscule that we ignore them for most cases.</p>
      <br>
		  <p><font color=maroon>5. The energy of a gas depends only on the overall temperature of a gas and nothing else.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left:40px">This is probably the most difficult to understand intuitively. The energy of a gas is dependent only on the temperature of the gas. No matter what the volume or pressure the gas is at, the energy of the gas will always be the same for a certain temperature. We say that the energy of the gas is temperature-dependent.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="margin-left:40px">The way we calculate the energy is through the following formula:</p>
      <br>
      <p align=center><b>`KE=3/2*k_B*T`</b></p>
      <br>
      <p align=center><font color=brown>Where `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, `1.38*10^(-23)&nbsp;("m"^2*"kg")/("s"^2*K)`, and T is the temperature in `K`</font></p>
      <br>
      <p style="margin-left:40px">Neither the identity of the gas nor its pressure and volume matter when calculating the energy of the gas. The only property that matters is its temperature.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h7><center>Boltzmann Distributions</center></h7>
      <br>
      <p>At any given temperature of a gas, the molecules are not all travelling at the same velocity. Some of the molecules will travel at a lower velocity than others, while some will travel with a higher velocity. We can relate the speed of the molecules in a gas to the temperature of the gas through a <b>Boltzmann Distribution:</b></p>
      <br>
      <img class=center src="../images/boltzmann-distribution.png" width=80%>
      <br>
      <p>The y-axis, `n`, is the probability of a molecule being at the corresponding temperature. For the red curve at `-100&deg;C`, the probability of a molecule travelling at `(0&nbsp;m)/s` is almost 0, whereas the probability of a molecule travelling at `(300&nbsp;m)/s` is extremely high.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Notice that as the temperature increases from `-100&deg;C rArr 20&deg;C rArr 600&deg;C`, the curve flattens out. For the blue curve at `600&deg;C`, the probability of molecules being at different velocities is much more balanced than at the lower temperatures. Additionally, the probability of molecules being at higher velocities is greater. We can generalize these observations through the following statements:</p>
      <br>
      <p align=center><b>Gas molecules at a certain temperature travel within a range of velocities.</b>
      <br>
      <p align=center><b>The higher the temperature of a gas, the larger the range of velocities, and the faster the overall gas. </b></p>

		  <h7><center>Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures</center></h7>
		  <br>
		  <p>Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures describes the individual contributions to the total pressure of a gas when the gas is a mixture of different gases. Imagine you had a gas of composed of `A/3`, `B/4`, and `(7C)/12` where `A`, `B`, and `C` are different gases. If the total pressure is `1&nbsp;"atm"`, how much of the total pressure is contributed from `A`, `B`, and `C`?</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>It turns out that `A` contributes to `1/3`, `B` contributes to `1/4`, and `C` contributes to `7/12` of the total pressure. This is <b>Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure</b>, which is commonly stated as:</p>
		  <br>
		  <p align=center><b>In a mixture of gases, the partial pressure of each component is equal to its mole fraction.</b></p>
		  <br>
		  <p>The mole fraction (`X`) of a gas refers to the number of moles of the gas divided by the total number of moles. For example, the mole fraction of `A` is calculated as:</p>
		  <br>
		  <p align=center>`X_A = n_A/n_("total") = (1/3&nbsp;"moles A")/((1/3&nbsp;"moles A")+(1/4&nbsp;"moles B")+(7/12&nbsp;"moles C"))= 1/3`</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>If we want to find the partial pressure of gas `A`, then we just multiply the total pressure by the mole fraction of `A`:</p>
		  <br>
		  <p align=center>`P_A= P_"total"&nbsp;X_A = (1&nbsp;"atm")(1/3)=1/3&nbsp;"atm"`</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>This means that gas `A` contributes to `1/3` of the total pressure of the entire gas. We can therefore say Dalton's Law in a mathematical sense:</p>
		  <br>
		  <p align=center><b>`P_i=P_"total"&nbsp;X_i`</b></p>
		  <br>
		  <p align=center><font color=brown>Where `i` is any gas.</font></p>
		  <br>
		  <p>A simpler way to think about Dalton's Law is that, in a mixture of gases, the contributions to the total pressure of the gas is the mole fraction of each individual component. If you have a gas consisting of 50% `A` and 50% `B`, then gas `A` will contribute to 50% of the total pressure and gas `B` will contribute to 50% of the total pressure.</p>
