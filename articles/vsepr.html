		<h7><center>VSEPR Theory</center></h7>
		<br>
		<p>Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) is a theory that states that the 3d orientation, also known as the <b>molecular geometry</b>, of a molecule is not dependent on its chemical formula but on the repulsion of valence electrons. In other words, two molecules with the general formulas `AB_3` may look completely different in real life: one may be a pyramid whereas the other may be completely flat. This is the case of `BF_3` and `NH_3`: both have the general formula `AB_3`, but `NH_3` on the left is a tri-pod shape whereas `BF_3` on the right is a 3-legged starfish shape.</p>
		<br>
		<img class=center src="../images/bf3-ammonia-3.png" width=60%>
		<br>
		<p>The reason behind this is that the two structures have a different number and arrangement of valence electrons. <font color=red>Molecular geometry is determined by the arrangement of valence electrons.</font></p>
		<br>
				<img class=center src="../images/vsepr-geometry.jpg" width=50%>
    <br>
		<p>Take a look at the Lewis structures of `NH_3` and `BF_3`. The only difference is the number of electrons on the central atom: N has a lone pair whereas B does not. The basic idea behind VSEPR is that <font color=red>electron pairs will repel each other</font>. This is why `NH_3` has a tri-pod shape: the lone pair on top of N pushes the other electrons (in the bond) away from it. <font color=red>The lone pair is usually not shown in 3d models and thus you have to visualize it yourself.</font></p>
		<br>
		<p>One key point is that <b>lone pairs take up more room than single bonds do.</b> If you substitute a single bond with a lone pair, the lone pair will repel the other electron groups away from it more than the single bond would. This will become important when discussing bond angles.</p>
		<br><br>
		
		<h7><center>Molecular Geometry Specifics</center></h7>
		<br>
		<p>The following chart provides the different molecular geometries and the conditions in which they arise. We're going to discuss each one individually, but note that <font color=red>you can determine the molecular geometry of a molecule solely by the number of bonds and lone pairs around the central atom.</font></p>
		<br>
		<img class=center src="../images/molecular-geometry.png" width=60%>
		<br>
		<p>Let's say you had the formula of water, `H_2O`, and wanted to know its molecular geometry.</p>
		<img align=left src="../images/water.png" width=25%>
		<p>The central O atom has 4 groups of electrons around it: 2 bonds and 2 unpaired electrons, also called <b>lone pairs.</b> If we look up at the table, we can find on the left side a column for molecules with 4 electrons groups, and within that group a molecule with 2 lone pairs. The molecular geometry for a water molecule is bent, which is why the water molecule isn't a straight H-O-H molecule. The molecular geometry chart may seem like a lot of information at first, but over time it will become intuitive. You'll see that the chart follows a very straightforward pattern of logic.</p>
		<br>
		<p>One brief thing to take note of is that there are multiple linear and bent geometries. They will have different numbers of bonds and lone pairs, but the end result will be the same. For example, both molecules with 2 bonds and 0 lone pairs and 2 bonds and 3 lone pairs will be linear. From all outward appearances, they will look identical however.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Now let's go over the geometries in terms of the number of electron pairs:</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h9><font color=black size=6>2 Electron Groups</font></h9>
		<br>
		<p>This group consists only of the <b>linear</b> geometry. Linear geometries occur when there are only <b>2 bonds and 0 lone pairs</b>. Examples include `BeH_2`</p>
		<br>
		<img class=center src="../images/beryllium-hydride.png" width=40%>
		<br>
		<p>Notice that there will be several different linear geometries. All linear molecules share the property that they are completely straight i.e <font color=red>the bond angle from one bond to another is `180^@`</font>.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h9><font color=black size=6>3 Electron Groups</font></h9>
		<br>
		<p>This group consists of trigonal planar molecules and bent molecules. We've gone over examples of these two: `BF_3` is a trigonal planar molecule whereas water is a bent molecule.</p>
		<br>
		<img class=center src="../images/trigonal-planar.png" width=40%>
		<br>
		<p>In a <b>trigonal planar</b> molecule, there are <b>3 bonds and 0 lone pairs</b>, with <font color=red> bond angles of `120^@`</font>. In <b>bent</b> molecules, the <font color=red>bond angle is slightly less than `120^@`</font>. This is because <b>lone pairs take up more room than single bonds do.</b> Therefore, the lone pair in a bent molecule takes up more room than the 3rd bond in a trigonal planar molecule does, thereby reducing the angle to slightly less than `120^@`.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h9><font color=black size=6>4 Electron Groups</font></h9>
		<p>This group consist of tetrahedral, trigonal pyramidal, and bent geometries.</p>
		<br>
		<img align=left src="../images/cool-methane.png" width=30%>

		<p>The <b>tetrahedral</b> geometry exists when there are <b>4 bonds and 0 lone pairs</b>. This is one of the most important and common geometries, as many molecules will adopt this. For example, `CH_4` adopts a tetrahedral geometry (left). The <font color=red>bond angle for tetrahedral molecules is approximately `109.5^@`.</font></p>
		<br><br><br><br><br>
		<img align=right src="../images/ammonia.png" width=30%>
		<p>The <b>trigonal pyramidal</b> geometry exists when there are <b>3 bonds and 1 lone pair</b>. This is seen in ammonia (right). The bond angle for trigonal pyramidal geometries is <font color=red>less than `109.5^@`</font> due to the additional repulsion from the lone pair. The single lone pair sits on top of the molecule where the 4th bond in the tetrahedral structure is.</p>
		<br>
		<img align=left src="../images/water.png" width=30%>
		<p>The final 4 electron group geometry is the <b>bent</b> geometry. This occurs when there are <b>2 bonds and 2 lone pairs</b>. Note that this is the same general geometry as the bent molecule in the 3 electron group, but consists of a different number of electron pairs. A common example of a bent molecule is the water molecule (left).</p>
		<br><br>
		<h9><font color=black size=6>5 Electron Groups</font></h9>
		<p>The 5 electron group consists of the trigonal bypyramidal, see-saw, T-shaped, and linear geometries.</p>
		<br>
		<img align=right src="../images/tbp.png" width=40%>
		<p>The <b>trigonal bipyramidal</b>, abbreviated TBP, is found when there are <b>5 bonds and 0 lone pairs</b> (right). There are two different regions of bonds in TBPs: the axial and the equitorial. The 2 <b>axial</b> bonds lay along the axis, whereas the 3 <b>equitorial</b> lay on the "equator" of the molecule. <font color=red>The bond angle between the 2 axial bonds is `90^@` whereas the angle between the 3 equitorial bonds is `120^@`</font>. The angle between each equitorial and axial bond is `90^@`. You can think of a TBP as a combination of a trigonal pyramidal on the equitorial and a linear molecule on the axial.</p>
		<br><br><br>
		
		<img align=left src="../images/seesaw.png" width=40%>
		<p>The <b>See-Saw</b> geometry (It vaguely resembles a see-saw) occurs when there are <b>4 bonds and 1 lone pair</b> (left). Just like the TBP, the see-saw has equitorial and axial regions. The linear (straight) portion is the axial whereas the portion with the bent bonds is the equitorial. <font color=red>The equitorial bond angles are slightly less than `90^@` and the axial bond angles is slightly less than `120^@`.</font> This is because of the added repulsion from the lone pair, which is located on the equitorial position where the normal 3rd bond would be.</p>
		<br>
		<img align=right src="../images/t.png" width=30%>
		<p>The <b>T-Shaped</b> geometry occurs when there are <b>3 bonds and 2 lone pairs</b> (right). The <font color=red>bond angle between all of the bonds is slightly less than `90^@`</font> due to the added repulsion from the lone pairs. The lone pairs sit where the other 2 equitorial bonds usually would.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The last geometry of this number of electron pairs is the <b>linear</b> geometry. This geometry occurs when there are <b>2 bonds and 3 lone pairs</b>, and looks indistinguishable from the other linear geometries. The bond angle between the two bonds is `180^@`.</p>
		
		<br><br>
		<h9><font color=black size=6>6 Electron Groups</font></h9>
		<br>
		<p>The 6 electron group geometries consist of the octahedral, square pyramidal, and square planar geometries.</p>
		<br>
		<img align=right src="../images/octahedral.png" width=35%>
		<p>The <b>octahedral</b> geometry (right) occurs when there are <b>6 bonds and 0 lone pairs</b>. The <font color=red>bond angles is `90^@` between all bonds.</font> The octahedral geometry is a very common geometry alongside the tetrahedral.</p>
		<br><br>
    <img align=left src="../images/square-pyramidal.png" width=40%>
    <p>The <b>square pyramidal</b> has <b>5 bonds and 1 lone pair</b>. The 1 lone pair sits on the "bottom" of the molecule (reference left diagram) and causes a repulsion of the rest of the bonds. The result is that <font color=red>the bond angles are all slightly lower than `90^@`.</font></p>
    <br>
    <img align=right src="../images/square-planar.png" width=35%>
    <p>The last geometry is the <b>square planar</b> which is just <b>4 bonds and 2 lone pairs</b> (right). The two lone pairs sit on "top" and "bottom" of the molecule, effectively balancing each other out. This results in the <font color=red> bond angles being exactly `90^@`</font>.</p>

    <br><br>Structures</center></h7>
    <br>
    <p>Most of the time, you'll be determining the molecular geometry from the Lewis structure. It is therefore important to be able to determine the molecular geometry from a 2D Lewis structure. The most important thing is to <font color=red>count the number of bonds and lone pairs</font> (Note that double and triple bonds are counted as one <b>set</b> of bonds. Once you do this, you can simply consult a chart like the one above.</p>
        <br>
    <p>Here's a simulation to play with so that you can visualize each shape. Click and Model and enable lone pairs and bond angles and try to construct each of the different geometries. Afterwards, go to real molecules and check out a few of the molecules and their geometries. See if you can draw out the Lewis structures for the molecules and try identifying their geometries.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Here are some Lewis structures to practice with:</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>#1. Identify the molecular geometry of the following molecules by counting all sets of bonds and lone pairs.</b></p>
    <br>
    <img class=center src="../images/mg-practice-1.jpg" width=55%>
    <br>
    <p align=center><font color=darkslategrey> a) 6 bonds, 0 lone pairs. Octahedral.</font></p>
    <p align=center><font color=darkslategrey> b) 3 bonds, 1 lone pairs. Trigonal Pyramidal.</font></p>
    <p align=center><font color=darkslategrey> c) 4 bonds, 0 lone pairs. Tetrahedral.</font></p>
    <p align=center><font color=darkslategrey> d) 2 bonds, 0 lone pairs. Linear.</font></p>
    <br>
    <p><b>#2. Identify the molecular geometry of the following molecules.</b></p>
    <br>
    <img class=center src="../images/mg-practice-2.jpg" width=55%>
    <br>
    <p align=center><font color=darkslategrey> a) Each C has 1 bond and 0 lone pairs: Linear.</font></p>
    <p align=center><font color=darkslategrey> b) 4 bonds, 0 lone pairs. Tetrahedral. Note that the molecules around the central C differ, but this does not affect the molecular geometry.</font></p>
    <p align=center><font color=darkslategrey> c) 3 bonds, 0 lone pairs. Trigonal planar.</font></p>
    <p align=center><font color=darkslategrey> d) 5 bonds, 1 lone pair. See-saw</font></p>
    <p align=center><font color=darkslategrey> e) Each P has 3 bonds and 1 lone pair. The molecular geometry around each P is trigonal pyramidal.</font></p>
    <p align=center><font color=darkslategrey> f) 2 bonds, 1 lone pair. Bent</font></p>
    <p align=center><font color=darkslategrey> g) 4 bonds, 0 lone pairs. Tetrahedral</font></p>
    <p align=center><font color=darkslategrey> h) 3 bonds, 2 lone pairs. T-shaped</font></p>
    <p align=center><font color=darkslategrey> i) 4 bonds, 2 lone pairs. Square Planar</font></p>

    <br><br>
		<h7><center>Electron Geometry</center></h7>
		<br>
		<p>You may come across questions asking for the <b>electron geometry</b> as opposed to the molecular geometry. In electron geometry, <font color=red> both bonds and lone pairs are considered the same</font>. In other words, any molecule with 4 groups of something, be it 3 bonds and 1 lone pair or 2 bonds and 2 lone pairs, will have the same electron geometry.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Electron geometry is just a simplified molecular geometry. A brief example can be ammonia, which has 3 bonds and 1 lone pair. In molecular geometry, ammonia would be a trigonal pyrimidal. In terms of electron geometry, ammonia is a tetrahedral molecule because there is no distinguishment between the bonds and the lone pair.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Arrangements such as trigonal pyramidal or square planar don't exist when discussing electron geometry because those structures require the counting of lone pairs. The only electron geometries that exist are linear, tetrahedral, trigonal bypyramidal, and octahedral structures. Let's end with a quote:</p>
